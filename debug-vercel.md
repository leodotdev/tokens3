# Vercel Deployment Debug

## Current Issue
Vercel is showing the raw `index.js` file content instead of the built web app.

## What Should Happen
1. Vercel should run `npm run build` (which runs our custom build.js)
2. Build.js should run `expo export --platform web --clear`
3. This should create a `dist/` folder with index.html and other web assets
4. Vercel should serve the contents of the `dist/` folder

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
Make sure these are set:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 2. Check Build Logs in Vercel
Look for:
- "Building Expo web app for production..."
- "Build completed successfully!"
- List of generated files

### 3. If Build is Failing
The issue might be:
- Missing dependencies
- Environment variables not accessible during build
- Expo CLI not found

### 4. Alternative: Manual Deploy
If automated build fails, you can:
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Upload the `dist/` folder contents manually
3. Or use `vercel --prod` CLI

### 5. Fallback Solution
If Expo web export continues to fail, we can:
1. Switch to Create React App + React Native Web
2. Use Next.js with React Native Web
3. Use Vite + React Native Web
