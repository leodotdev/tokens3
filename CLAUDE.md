# Tokens3 - Project Memory & Architecture

## Project Vision
**Tokens3** is a complete restart of the tokens project series, built as simple and elegant as possible. This is the third iteration, learning from `tokens` (basic React Native + SQLite) and `tokens2` (Supabase + advanced UI) to create the most refined version yet.

### Core Philosophy: Family Values Design Manifesto
Following https://benji.org/family-values principles:

**Simplicity**: Reveal features gradually, fundamentals at fingertips
**Fluidity**: Seamless transitions, constantly evolving interface  
**Delight**: Selective magical moments, emotional connection over pure functionality

## Tech Stack - Minimal & Elegant
- **React Native + Expo** (v53) - Cross-platform foundation
- **Supabase MCP** - Cloud database, auth, real-time, storage 
- **Gluestack** - Universal UI components, design system
- **React Native Reanimated** - Fluid animations and transitions
- **FluentUI Emoji** - All icons and graphics (no other icon libraries)
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Git Integration** - Auto commit/push to https://github.com/leodotdev/tokens3.git

## Architecture Principles
1. **Simplicity First**: Start with core features, add complexity gradually
2. **Universal Components**: Gluestack for consistent cross-platform UI
3. **Fluid Interactions**: Reanimated for meaningful animations
4. **Emotional Design**: FluentUI emoji for personality and delight
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features reveal as needed
6. **Cloud-Native**: Supabase for all backend needs

## Project Evolution Context
- **tokens**: Local SQLite, basic CRUD, learning project
- **tokens2**: Supabase migration, advanced UI, production-ready
- **tokens3**: Minimal elegance, emotion-first design, refined architecture

## Development Heuristics
- Always check with user before major changes
- Create CLAUDE.md files in each significant folder
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Follow Family Values in every interaction design
- Use only specified tech stack (no additional dependencies without approval)
- Prioritize user delight over feature completeness

## Key Learnings from Previous Versions
- Supabase provides excellent developer experience for React Native
- Grid-based UI with search/filter works well for product catalogs
- Web scraping Amazon products is valuable but complex
- Real-time updates create magical user experiences
- Simple, focused feature sets are more delightful than feature bloat

## Current Status
Fresh start with basic Expo + NativeWind setup. Ready to build something beautiful and simple.
